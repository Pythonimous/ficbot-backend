      "Lelouch vi Britannia (ルルーシュ・ヴィ・ブリタニア, Rurūshu Vui Buritania) is the main protagonist of the anime/manga series Code Geass. He is the Eleventh Prince of the Holy Britannian Empire and the 98th Emperor of Britannia, Charles zi Britannia.\n",
      "Lelouch is a very clever individual who is also calm, sophisticated, and arrogant due to his aristocratic upbringing. While at school, Lelouch conducts himself as a friendly, likable, and often an easygoing student. However, this is a mask to hide his true nature. While as Zero, his true nature is expressed. His charisma and beliefs in justice gain him the trust and respect of many soldiers and leaders.\n",
      "He is known for having a very stoic personality. He never cared about schoolwork, seeing the entire thing as trivial, even though his high intelligence would make it easy for him. He enjoys seeking out challenges, often playing chess against the nobility. In general, Lelouch takes most day-to-day affairs with open disinterest, often not even noticing the affection of others, especially Shirley, his classmate. He has a strong dislike for nobles, viewing them as tepid and \"overprivileged parasites.\"\n",
      "Many characters have noted that Lelouch is entirely selfish, as his desire to remake the world into what he wants it to become from his desire to avenge his mother's apparent death and Nunnally's sake. However, in time, he realizes that this goal is not just for them but also the entire world.\n",
      "Despite his cold, calculating demeanor and ruthlessness in battle, he can be a rather compassionate person to his friends and loved ones. To Nunnally, he is a loving older brother, and to Suzaku, a loyal friend, although the two are enemies. Lelouch, at first glance, seems to have relatively little concern for the well-being of his subordinates, but in reality, he does care about them, seeing them as valuable allies.\n",
      "As the series progresses, Lelouch suffers traumas and further losses that further deepen his resolve. However, he also grows less merciful to his enemies if he cannot Geass them.\n",
      "Character Background (as Lelouch):\n",
      "Lelouch was born on December 5, 1999, a.t.b. as Lelouch vi Britannia, the son of Charles Zi Britannia, and the late Imperial Consort Marianne, making Lelouch the Eleventh Prince of the Holy Britannian Empire. He was in line to be the seventeenth heir to the throne before his mother's assassination and his sister's crippling in the same incident. A ten-year-old Lelouch confronted the Emperor afterward and accused him of leaving his mother defenseless, even going as far as renouncing his entitlement to the throne. In response, his father banished him to Japan and used him as a political hostage in the Sakuradite conflict.\n",
      "During his stay at the Kururugi household, he first met Suzaku Kururugi, with whom the young Lelouch did not interact initially in a friendly way, before later becoming friends. However, when Britannia finally developed its Knightmare Frames fleet and decided to invade Japan to seize control of the Sakuradite mines, discarding Lelouch's use as a diplomatic tool. Lelouch, fearing for his sister's safety, hid their true identities and sought the help of the Ashford family, who were his mother's allies.\n",
      "His mother's death and his father's apparent lack of concern regarding it were considerable blows to Lelouch. He always felt that it was unfair for both his mother and sister and made it his goal to pursue a better world for Nunnally. He also seeks to discover the valid reason for his mother's death, who got murdered in the Aries Imperial Palace, a place terrorists would be unlikely to penetrate successfully without being noticed, if at all.\n",
      "Character Background (as Zero):\n",
      "Shortly after gaining the power of Geass from C.C., Lelouch assumes the secret identity of Zero, a mysterious, masked revolutionary dressed in a black helmet and cloak. The helmet has a retractable plate over the left eye so Lelouch can use his Geass. In this guise, he forms the Black Knights, initially composed of Kaname Ohgi's resistance group members. The goal of this vigilante group is a campaign against influential individuals who oppress the helpless, which he eventually expands into reforming Japan as an independent nation.\n",
      "Lelouch is willing to do whatever it takes to carry out his goal, even if it means lying to his followers and using people as bait for the outcome he desires. However, he has trouble putting his close friends in harms way for the sake of his goal, which is a weakness as a commander but a remnant of his humanity and sanity. In particular, his feelings for Nunnally often hinder his plans, particularly at the end of the first season, where he abandons a massive war with Britannian forces to rescue her. He has come to embrace the fact that he needs to destroy before reconstruction can occur, even if it means harming those he cares for.\n",
      "Initially, Lelouch is motivated by the desire to avenge his mother's death and construct an ideal world where his sister Nunnally can live peacefully. After Nunnally becomes Viceroy of Area 11, and her wishes conflict with his goals, his friends help him to realize that his rebellion is no longer just for Nunnally but for all the people of the world.\n",
      "First Season:\n",
      "Lelouch makes his first appearance at the beginning of the first episode of the series, as a child, along with Suzaku Kururugi watching the Britannian Military entering Japan, with the figure of C.C. watching them.\n",
      " He is introduced to be a student of Ashford Academy, a member of its Student Council. He is a brilliant thinker who is exceptionally talented at chess. He lives with his younger sister, Nunnally, and their maid, Sayoko, in the Student Council building of Ashford Academy, where they are looked after by the Ashford Family.\n",
      "Lelouch and his friend Rivalz enter a room where a chess match was being played, with Lelouch claiming he can turn the situation on the chess table in under 9 minutes. He effortlessly crushes him in a short period (8 minutes, 32 seconds) while the noble gapes at his defeat.  As they walk out of the casino, they are interrupted by Clovis's \"heart-breaking\" speech, which turns out to be an act. On the road, Rivalz accidentally cuts the way of the terrorists, resulting in their vehicle's crash.\n",
      "Soon enough, Lelouch is swept into the conflict between the Holy Britannian Empire and Japanese Resistance Operatives. Suzaku, who Lelouch had not met for seven years, finds the vehicle and confronts Lelouch, who he mistakes as a terrorist. Nagata opens the capsule, and instead of gas, a restrained C.C. appears. Before they can get answers, Suzaku's superior comes and tells him not to question his briefing and shoot the \"terrorist,\" Lelouch. When he refuses, he got shot in the back. Lelouch and C.C. take the opportunity to escape. Just as they seem to have evaded detection, Lelouch's phone rings, giving him away; as they are about to kill him, C.C. jumps in front and shot in the forehead. However, surprisingly, he is grabbed by the hand of C.C., who proposes a contract that would allow him to live and endow him with Geass, the power of kings. He accepts and stands up, reinvigorated, and uses his ability to make his pursuers kill themselves.\n",
      "Following his actions, Villetta Nu appears in her Sutherland, and Lelouch decides to take it and uses his Geass on her. After using his newfound power, he attempts to crush the rest of the Britannian Military that is wiping out the Elevens in the Shinjuku Ghetto. He uses Ohgi's Resistance Group and gives them orders to eliminate the Britannian Soldiers. \n",
      "Later on, Britannian Army's experimental Knightmare Lancelot, piloted by Suzaku, ruins Lelouch's plans. Just as the Britannian Army corners the terrorists, Clovis orders an immediate cease-fire under coercion by Lelouch. Lelouch confronts Clovis at gunpoint about the murder of his mother, Marianne vi Britannia, before killing him.\n",
      "When he returns to Ashford Academy, he discovers that Kallen Stadtfeld, one of the terrorists he helped Shinjuku Ghetto, attends the same school. Limitations to his power are also revealed when he attempts to question her and unsuccessfully erase her memory. Both he and Kallen attempt to gain information from each other through Sayoko.\n",
      "To Lelouch's surprise, C.C., the girl who gave him Geass, shows up alive in his residence. He discovers that she is immortal and learns more about his Geass ability.\n",
      "Unknown to Lelouch, Cornelia had set a trap for Zero at the Saitama Ghetto by simulating the conditions in Shinjuku Ghetto. Despite C.C.'s warnings, Lelouch takes the bait and goes to the aid of the Saitama resistance. His plan falls apart from a combination of Cornelia's superior tactics and the resistance cell's different motivations. Lelouch is cornered and nearly discovered, but C.C. dons his Zero costume and distracts the Britannian Army, allowing him to escape. Lelouch blames his defeat on the undisciplined rebels and resolves to build something better than a mere resistance unit, first an army, \"people,\" and finally a nation.\n",
      "He later forms The Order of the Black Knights during the Japanese Liberation Front Hotel Incident after rescuing the hostages. He leads the Black Knights becoming a revolutionary and gains popular support amongst the Elevens.\n",
      "The turning point in his rebellion comes when Euphemia li Britannia declares the region under Mt. Fuji, the Special Administrative Zone of Japan, giving the Japanese people their name and country back, albeit in a much smaller area. This decrement effectively destroys any possibility of the Black Knights' rebellion; acceptance would render them powerless, and refusal would make them pariahs. Lelouch confronts her at the opening ceremony and tries to have her shoot him, hoping to make himself a martyr. When she mentions giving her title up, he surrenders and agrees to work with her. However, his Geass permanently activates, and an offhand comment about ordering her to kill the Japanese forces her to do just that. Lelouch got forced to kill Euphemia to end the ensuing massacre, but he becomes a hero of the people in doing so. \n",
      "Using this newfound support, Lelouch announces the creation of the United States of Japan and can lead an attack on the Tokyo Settlement. The episode goes well at first, but when Lelouch learns that Nunnally got kidnapped, he abandons the battle, leaving his forces helpless against the much better organized Britannian forces.\n",
      "On his way to rescue Nunnally, Jeremiah intercepts him after an ensuing battle. Lelouch and C.C. make their way to Kamine Island to search for Nunnally, but Jeremiah appears once more. Being unable to defeat him as the Gawain has taken its toll in the many battles it has participated in, C.C. decides to sacrifice herself and drops Lelouch off.\n",
      "Afterward, Suzaku Kuruguri confronted Lelouch. Kallen appears as well, and Suzaku reveals to her that Zero's true identity is Lelouch. Lelouch attempts to broker a truce, trying to convince Suzaku to help him find Nunnally, but Suzaku is distraught over the death of Euphemia and refuses to listen. An angered Lelouch draws his pistol, and he and Suzaku attempt to shoot one another. A single gunshot is heard as the screen fades to black at the end of the first season.\n",
      "Second Season:\n",
      "One year later, Lelouch is once again a student at Ashford Academy. He has had his memories rewritten by Charles Zi Britannia, revealed to possess a Geass power of his own, erasing his memory of being a prince, being Zero, and having a younger brother named Rolo Lamperouge instead of a sister.\n",
      "He is seen running away from Villetta Nu, who is revealed to be a teacher now in the first episode. He is able to leave Ashford Academy with Rolo to go gamble at Babel Tower. It is here where Kallen and the remnants of the Black Knights attempt to retrieve Zero. After being cornered by the OSI, C.C. appears and restores Lelouch's memories. Afterward, Urabe and Kallen appear in their respective Knightmares, and he resumes leadership of the Black Knights. Initially, Lelouch makes his base in the Chinese Federation's consulate, using his Geass on the High Eunuch stationed there so Hifh Eunuch will welcome them.\n",
      "When Nunnally is appointed as Viceroy of Area 11 and announces her plans to re-establish the Special Administrative Zone of Japan, Lelouch falls into a depression since he would be impeding her wishes by continuing his rebellion. He nearly begins taking Refrain before Kallen stops him. With the help of Kallen and his friends at the Ashford Academy, Lelouch realizes that his mission no longer revolves solely around Nunnally but concerns the rest of his friends and the Japanese people as well.\n",
      "Lelouch engineers the legal exile of the Black Knights by getting the Britannians to agree to exile Zero in exchange for bringing one million participants for Nunnally's new Japan. By having them all dress as Zero, he forces Suzaku to exile the Black Knights. They successfully escape to the Chinese Federation, where Lelouch begins allying with the other world powers to create a force that rivals Britannia.\n",
      "During his time in Area 11, Jeremiah Gottwald restores Shirley's memories right before she got shot by Rolo Lamperouge, an assassin for the Geass Directorate. Unable to retaliate against either, as they are now his allies, Lelouch instead wipes out the Directorate, in the process learning of C.C.'s wish to die and that the Emperor has become immortal. C.C. would have had Lelouch kill her and take on her immortality, but instead spares him by placing him inside her memories while the Emperor kills her. Lelouch refuses to let her die unhappy, encouraging her to live on, but memories of her life after gaining Geass are erased during their escape.\n",
      "Once Lelouch's new alliance, the United Federation of Nations, is formed, their first act is to liberate Japan. To ensure Nunnally's safety, Lelouch meets with Suzaku in an attempt to convince him to help. Lelouch takes full responsibility for all that he has done rather than admit the truth, but Suzaku agrees to help since he recognized what Lelouch is doing.\n",
      "Kallen meets up with Lelouch to tell him that Ohgi wants him to come to warehouse 9. In the elevator, Kallen expresses to Lelouch her gratitude for Nunnally's help when she was captured. They then arrive to see that the core members of the Black Knights are betraying him, stating they know his real identity and Geass power. With Lelouch backed into a corner, he reveals his identity and lies that everything he has done was for his entertainment to save Kallen from dying with him, telling her that she needs to live. \n",
      "As they are about to gun Lelouch down, Rolo appears in the Shinkirō to evacuate him but dies in the attempt as he overuses his Geass. Lelouch comes to terms with his feelings for Rolo and buries him properly as the little brother of .\n",
      "Following the betrayal of the Black Knights, Lelouch focuses on defeating the Emperor. Lelouch confronts the Emperor in the Sword of Akasha, where he learns the truth about his mother and Charles' plans. Lelouch denies their attempt to create a new world and kills both Charles and Marianne with C.C. and Suzaku. One month later, he installs himself as the 99th Emperor of Britannia and appoints Suzaku as his Knight of Zero. \n",
      "As Emperor, Lelouch abolishes all the oppressive laws and class systems of Britannia, frees every colony (thereby negating the concept of \"Numbers\"), and puts down all resistance to his goals. However, the seemingly benevolent acts are a smokescreen for his intention to take over the world, which he calls the Zero Requiem.\n",
      " He announces that Britannia intends to join the U.F.N. At the meeting, Lelouch takes the council members hostage after learning Britannia's large population would give him a majority voting block. This confusion brings him into conflict with Schneizel and the Black Knights, the former bringing his F.L.E.I.J.A.-equipped floating fortress into the battle. The biggest surprise comes when Nunnally is revealed to be alive and declares herself to be his and Suzaku's enemy. Though initially reluctant, Lelouch is convinced that he must fight her for the sake of his plan.\n",
      "Using Nina's countermeasure, Lelouch and Suzaku disable the F.L.E.I.J.A., and the two proceed to board the Damocles. He manages to place Schneizel under his control and then confronts Nunnally, who has regained her sight. Lelouch uses his Geass on Nunnally to get her to hand over the F.L.E.I.J.A. launch button and takes over Damocles. With no one left capable of opposing him, Lelouch becomes the ruler of the world. Sometime after the battle with Schneizel and the Black Knights, Lelouch appoints Marrybell in charge of Damocles.\n",
      "Lelouch arranges the public execution of the Black Knight leaders and the U.F.N. representatives. Suzaku, disguised as Zero, interrupts and kills Lelouch, the culmination of the Zero Requiem as they had planned.\n",
      "By directing all the hatred of the world onto him, Lelouch's death will serve to facilitate peace; while simultaneously redeeming both Lelouch's and Suzaku's sins by having them impose the most significant punishments on themselves. Finally, Lelouch wished for a tomorrow to Nunnally, life for Suzaku, who wanted to atone his since through death.\n",
      "At the same time, during the Glinda Knights' and Peace Mark's assault on Damocles, Marrybell and Orpheus fall to their deaths. Nunnally can only watch in shock. When Lelouch falls near her, she takes his hand and realizes that he had sacrificed himself on purpose, for her dream and world peace. Lelouch dies smiling in the arms of a crying Nunnally, saying he has destroyed the world and created it anew. Suzaku is left playing the role of Zero.\n",
      "The aftermath is narrated by Kallen, who ends up forgiving Lelouch as she has realized Lelouch's true intentions were noble and explained how the world is much better off with all the energy being focused on reconstruction. During the final scene of the series, C.C. makes one last remark to Lelouch about how she may have been wrong about Geass condemning one to a life of solitude.\n",
      "Geass:\n",
      "Lelouch's Geass, bestowed upon him by C.C., gives him \"The Power of Absolute Obedience,\" allowing him to plant commands within a person's mind upon eye contact in a manner comparable to hypnosis. Activation of his Geass is visually represented by the manifestation of a Geass Sigil in his left eye. Commands dictated are written into the minds of the designated targets, the Sigil projecting him from his eye to theirs.\n",
      " Lelouch could initially toggle Geass activation at will but subsequently lost this control and suffered from an affliction known as \"runaway Geass\" near the end of the first series. \n",
      "In the second season, C.C. gives Lelouch a contact lens that blocks his Geass but indicates that his Geass will eventually grow powerful enough to render it ineffective.\n",
      "Lelouch's Geass evolves to cover both of his eyes in episode 21 due to pushing his Geass to the limit, trying to command C's World, the collective unconscious of humanity itself. He receives a second contact lens to cover it later.\n",
      "Of all the Geass abilities in the series, Lelouch's has been explored the most and also seems to have the most restrictions, and side effects of any Geass introduced:Only affects the nervous system.\n",
      "Commands must be issued verbally.\n",
      "The victim must make direct eye contact for commands to be issued. The maximum effective distance is 272 meters. A line of sight via a reflective surface is sufficient for the effect to occur.\n",
      "Commands may be issued only once to any given individual, but any number of commands may be issued at the initial application so long as eye contact is unbroken. Since Jeremiah's Geass Canceller negates all Geass effects, those exposed to it may be commanded once again.\n",
      "The victim will not perform any action disallowed by their physical or mental capabilities, though they will try to carry out the command to the best of their ability. However, orders that affect the mind or consciousness (such as erasing memories or seeing hallucinations) are possible even though the victim could not usually force themselves to do so. Also, commands that ask for something unpreventable and physically impossible, such as telling a dying person to \"not die,\" will not have to make them immune to death.\n",
      "An action will be carried out for as long as dictated in its command or the indicated conditional circumstance. Eye contact does not need to be maintained for command execution to occur. No upper limit has been established, but the conditional command Lelouch gives Suzaku is still in effect more than a year later.\n",
      "The victim's memories for the duration of command issue and execution are sealed and cannot be recalled.\n",
      "As demonstrated in Princess Euphemia's response to the command that she kills the Japanese, a victim may resist a commanded action to some degree if it is utterly appalling and morally incomprehensible to them.\n",
